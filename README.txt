Lab Terminal aka. Lab.Gor.bio is a small web project/blog with appealing front-end animations.
You will find the landing page(s) in this repo. 
I desinged it to execute on modern browsers only and therefore used modern CSS functionalities.
The animations where objects float around randomly with random dimentions and the tv static effects were JavaScript-intensive.
Geometry formulas were implemented to achieve the visually appealing interface.
Only fundemental front-end modern web technologies were used in this project (HTML, JS, CSS).

Resources used during development:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript (for finding needed functions and useful methods)
https://openai.com/chatgpt (GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 were heavily used to correct both logical and syntax errors regarding the geometric calculations in JavaScript)
https://bard.google.com/ (Bard was heavily used to check for up-to-date methods in CSS)
